### Hello all! 👋🏽

I'm a software engineer at Zillow and I'm interested in Swift development for macOS and iOS.

### About me

You can find random musings at [my blog](https://nickkaczmarek.com). I'm working on bringing in more technology posts, but at the moment it's like a twitter just for me. I'm also on mastodon on the indieweb.social server at [@nick](https://indieweb.social/@nick).

I'm currently working on an app called [ThreeSongDJ](https://nickkaczmarek/threesongdj) which you can find on the iOS App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threesongdj/id1637762776). It's a free app that helps you create a playlist with friends in a fun and creative way. You'll need Apple Music to play music, but if you do please check it out and let me know what you think.
